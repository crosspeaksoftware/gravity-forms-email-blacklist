An add-on plugin for Gravity Forms that allows the Blacklisting of specific emails or email domains that are entered in [Email input fields](https://docs.gravityforms.com/email/) to throw a validation error and blocking the form submission.

=== Description ===

Email Blacklist Add-on for Gravity Forms was built to help block submissions from users with generic or competitors email addresses. Prevent the user form viewing the form's Confirmation or Notifications and remove non qualified leads from being collected.

This plugin allows site admins to create a list of emails, domains and/or top level domains that if used in an [email input field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/email/) on a Gravity Form will cause a validation error and block the submission. A default email blacklist and validation message can be created to use across all forms. These default settings can be overridden on a per email input field basis.

Default settings can be added in the  'Forms' > 'Settings' > 'Email Blacklist'. To add settings to an individual email input field just add one to the form and got to the input fields 'Advanced Settings' tab.

This plugin works by blocking either individual email addresses (exmple: jsmith@yahoo.com), email address domains (exmple: google.com), and/or, email address top-level domains (exmple: *.com).

=== Installation ===

1. Search for and install the 'Gravity Forms Email Blacklist' OR Upload `gravityforms-emailblacklist` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate form the Dashboard to the 'Forms' > 'Settings' > 'Email Blacklist' to make sure it is installed.
